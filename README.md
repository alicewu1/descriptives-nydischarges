**For HHA507 Assignment 4 Part 3**

**2016 NY Hospital Discharges De-Identified Dataset Used:** 
https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/gnzp-ekau). 


**This repo aims to:**
1. Apply knowledge of descriptive statistics to a dataset
2. Demonstrate adequate and detailed descriptive analysis for easy understanding amongst physicians and nurses


This descriptive analysis should be detailed enough so a physician or nurse
could understand what information is contained in the dataset, and what
potentially questions might be asked and answered. 

**I recommend that you try and create at least one descriptive table using the tableone
package.
